# Anime Character Recognition

A quick prototype model built in one day to recognize anime characters from images.

## ⚠️ Disclaimer

This project was developed rapidly for a hackathon and is **not intended for accurate use**. The model has limited performance and was trained on a small dataset in a short timeframe.

## Features

- Image classification using ResNet18
- FastAPI backend with drag-and-drop frontend
- Trained on ~8,000 images across 493 anime titles

## Limitations

- Low accuracy (~32% after initial epochs)
- Dataset requires cleaning
- Not suitable for production use
